## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**slarnett/slarnett** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->

- Iâ€™m currently working on learning Bash, Markdown, Git, Github (*it's not easy for me*), Azure (**I have *some* experience), Linux\*, and Python!
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anyting really. I'm willing to learn.
- Iâ€™m looking for help with coding. It's something I've wanted to do and haven't pushed myself enough to learn in the last 20 years
- Ask me about anything
- How to reach me: comment on anything in my repositories
- Fun fact: Adults don't know what they're doing, either
